 This repository is about building a tool to sonify astronomical images using Python. Here the process is documented into a structured folder system. A brief description-
 1.	In ‘Initial image loading and pixel extraction script’ we loaded a galaxy image from a .npy dataset using NumPy and then selected a high-resolution image. The pixel data of the image was processed by iterating over each pixel to extract its RGB values, which were then saved in a structured format (CSV file) with row, column, and RGB components. Finally, we visualized the image and its pixel structure using matplotlib.
 2.	In 'Mapping Pixel Data to Sound Parameters' with the help of the Pydub library, we have mapped pixel data of RGB images onto sound parameters. Red channel controls frequency (from 200 Hz to 2000 Hz), the green channel controls volume of sound (from -20 dB to 0 dB), while the blue channel takes care of duration. The pixels were processed from the CSV file and sinewave audio segments were created and combined to create a single sound file which was then exported as a WAV file.
